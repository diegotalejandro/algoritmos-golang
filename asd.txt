well  everyone got up and going this morning  it's still raining  but that's okay with me  sort of suits my mood  i could easily have stayed home in bed with my book and the cats  this has been a lot of rain though  people have wet basements  there are lakes where there should be golf courses and fields  everything is green  green  green  but  it is supposed to be 26 degrees by friday  so we'll be dealing with mosquitos next week  i heard winnipeg described as an "old testament" city on urllink cbc radio one last week and it sort of rings true  floods  infestations  etc   etc
 my four year old never stops talking  she'll say "mom " and when i say "yes "  she'll say "ummm     ummm    oh yeah  where do lady bugs hide in the rain " anything to hear her own voice  very  very exhausting  now i remember  this is why i go to work   sigh
 actually it's not raining yet  but i bought 15 tickets to the urllink goldeyes game for my mom's birthday tonight  and it is supposed to rain  do they cancel baseball games because of rain  although the ballpark is beautiful  it ain't the urllink skydome   we used to go to the jays games occassionally when we lived in toronto and really like taking the kids to the goldeyes games now  i don't know what urllink blue jays tickets cost now  but i'm sure it's cheaper here in winnipeg  oh  i just checked and it definitely is
 ha  just set up my rss feed   that is so easy  why doesn't everyone do it  enough for today  the sun is shining and i should be outside planting my poor flowers  that have spent far too long in their pots  but i have 3 kindergartners and a preschooler who are refusing to go outside  little gameboy junkies    i should talk  last post today  i promise
 oh  which just reminded me  we were talking about canning food at coffee break this morning  is this becoming a lost art  are there any people under 40 who know how to do this  those of us at coffee that fall in that age range couldn't  what would happen if the world as we know it ceased to exist  a la urllink day after tomorrow which is only being released today and i can't wait to see   i love a good escapist picture with lots of special effects  and we had to preserve our food somehow  well  we in canada definitely would need to preserve our food  i found lots of sites on canning  including urllink this one   but i guess that wouldn't help me much if everything went  better print it out and keep it just in case
 i've tried starting blog after blog and it just never feels right  then i read today that it feels strange to most people  but the more you do it the better it gets  hmm  sounds suspiciously like something else   so i decided to give it another try  my husband bought me a notepad at urllink mcnally  the best bookstore in western canada  with that title and a picture of a 50s housewife grinning desperately  each page has something funny like "new curtains  hurrah "  for some reason it struck me as absolutely hilarious and has stuck in my head ever since  what were those women thinking
 my 20th high school urllink reunion is this weekend  there are over 100 people coming  so it should be a good time  lots of names from the past  funny  i barely ever run into anyone  and yet a lot are still in the city
 we always have pizza on friday nights  it takes the stress out of "what am i going to make for dinner" and the kids look forward to it  in fact  many of their friends look forward to it too  but tonight we are having a family gathering at my mom's and i've offered to make pizza for all the kids  so i've been madly making dough in my breadmaker  which is very easy but still needs to be done  and freezing it  now i have to go home and cut vegetables for the vegetarian cousins' pizzas and grate a huge amount of cheese  then i'll have to cart it all over to my mom's without wrecking the crusts  it is not the usual relaxing friday night  but this hasn't been a relaxed week at all
 okay  i saw it this past weekend  not as good as independence day for sure  better than raising helen which i also saw  yes  two movies in one weekend  one was with book club  and one was with my husband since we hadn't been out together forever  guess which was with whom
 i've been cataloguing film scripts at work  what fun  i have to look a lot of the writers up on the urllink imdb   what a great database  i read somewhere that there were lots of mistakes in there  but given the absolutely huge amount of information  it is bound to happen  and everything links  i love it  library catalogues should be so good  best of all is getting a little sneak peek into people's lives  just enough to get your imagination going
 paul martin promised today that if he is elected he will create 250 000 new affordable child care spaces  i think they promised something like that last time around too  but if they really want to do something for working women  they should make it easier for women to work and be with their families  an affordable child care space would be helpful  but i want to spend more time with my children  so i need more flexible working arrangements  instead of a year's maternity leave  what if they made it mandatory for employers to allow women five years of part time work  if we worked at least 50% they should have to hold our jobs for us  i think that would appeal to a lot of moms  and then there would be a lot of part time child care spaces too  which are impossible to find right now  yes  i'm still pondering quitting my job  it seems to me to be ineveitable now    just a question of when
 no  i still haven't seen it  but apparently it is urllink not so good unless you are a librarian  ha  i am
 well  it's over  it was good to see so many people  most haven't changed much  but some have changed a great deal  funny how things that were important in high school no longer are  anyway  it is over and i'm glad  i was very  very tired all week and am glad that i had 4 days off to snooze a bit
